# Banana-Leaf-Disease-Prediction


This project is aimed at detecting banana leaf diseases like Segatoka, Xanthomonas, etc. and differentiating them from healthy leaves. The project is built using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms.
This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can be used to classify and predict banana leaf disease. The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 images of healthy and diseased banana leaves. The model achieved an accuracy of 99% accuracy on the test set
